# Engineering Manager Hub
The aim of this repository is to provide a curated list of resources for, begineer as well as seasoned, software engineering managers. Top-down approach in delivering the information is used in order for the reader to find the valuable information right away and if he or she needs more in-depth insight, a link to more detailed articles/resources should be provided. Not every single concept in this repository is linked to a more detailed resource as it might come from my own on-the-job notes. 

Engineering Manager will be further addressed as *EM*.

## Role Definition
What is *really* is to be an Engineering Manager? What tasks does it involve and what are the boundaries of what you should or should not do? This is one of the questions that I have (and still am) asking myself. There is no one and always followed definition of ther role and it can vary greatly per organization.
## Recruitment
Hiring people into your team is probably the most crucial task on your engineering manager list. Without the right people, nothing will move forward. The following are observations/rules of thumb and resources that might come in hand.
1. Hire Slowly
2. Always Make a Hands-On Case Interview 
3. Actively Recruit on Community Sites Like Stackoverflow or Github
4. Go for great talend and not longetivity
5. Culture and personality fit over coding excellency
6. Aim for people that build things in their own free time
## Objectives Key Results (OKRs)


## Team Structure
Follow Scrum to the point that everyone is an engineer/developer or should you have dedicated QAs, Architects etc.
## People Development
You need to make sure that you and your reports find together the *hyperdrive* that will keep them engaged and motivated in their career. This is illustrated as follows.
